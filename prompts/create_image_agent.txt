I want you to implement a new agent. This agent will be responsble for generating a single image based on the content generated by the content agent. 
The image must be saved to a folder called data/images

Use image generation API from OpenAI. Use the "gpt-image-1" model.

Follow the same implementation framework you did for the rest of the agents. 

Make sure you follow the workspace rule.

Image generation documentation:

https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation

Code Example:

Geneerate Image:

curl -X POST "https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-image-1",
        "prompt": "A childrens book drawing of a veterinarian using a stethoscope to listen to the heartbeat of a baby otter."
    }' | jq -r '.data[0].b64_json' | base64 --decode > otter.png

Response:

from openai import OpenAI
import base64

client = OpenAI() 

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    input="Generate an image of gray tabby cat hugging an otter with an orange scarf",
    tools=[{"type": "image_generation"}],
)

# Save the image to a file
image_data = [
    output.result
    for output in response.output
    if output.type == "image_generation_call"
]
    
if image_data:
    image_base64 = image_data[0]
    with open("otter.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(base64.b64decode(image_base64))
