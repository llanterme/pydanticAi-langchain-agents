I want to dockerize a Python application that uses Poetry and Streamlit.
The app should run the Streamlit UI automatically when the container starts.

Here's the command I normally use to launch it:

poetry run streamlit run app.py

Please generate a Dockerfile that:

Installs Poetry

Installs the project dependencies via Poetry

Exposes the default Streamlit port

Sets the container’s entrypoint to run the above command

The app’s main file is app.py, and it’s in the root directory.
Optimize the image to be as lean as reasonably possible (e.g. use Python 3.10-slim or similar).
