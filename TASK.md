  - ResearchRequest, ResearchResponse with field descriptions
  - ContentRequest, ContentResponse with platform-specific logic
  - Enum types for Platform and Tone options
- âœ… Research Agent implementation (agents/research.py)
  - Using PydanticAI 0.2.15 with Agent and result_type pattern
  - No deprecated decorators used
  - Pure functions with proper typing
- âœ… Content Agent implementation (agents/content.py)
  - Platform-specific content generation with tailored prompts
  - Consuming research results through state transitions
  - Title generation for Medium platform only
- âœ… LangGraph workflow (flow/graph.py)
  - StateGraph with research â†’ content â†’ end flow
  - TypedDict for workflow state transitions
  - Properly typed state annotations
- âœ… CLI application (main.py)
  - Topic, platform, and tone command line arguments
